# python-programming
Having worked on both java and Python, two of the most powerful programming languages, personally felt the python is a very simple and can be quickly learnt with much lesser effort in a very shorter duration. With ever increasing importance of its adoption across the usecases, it has beocme the most default option to kickstart any new project or prototype to quickly demostarte the idea to anyone. 

This space is to capture code developed during my journey of learning python programming and also some of the projects completed out of interest & curiosity to build some ideas that would improve efficiency and automate stuff.
